# 🤖 Bash-Based Naive Obstacle Avoider for ROS 2

This project implements a basic obstacle avoidance system for a mobile robot using Bash scripting and ROS 2 parameters. It uses laser scan (`/scan`), odometry (`/odom`), and IMU data to control the robot's motion via `cmd_vel` parameters.

Designed for simplicity and education, this is a lightweight alternative to Python/Cpp nodes in ROS 2.

## 🧠 Features

- 🛑 Naive obstacle avoidance logic using front, left, and right distance thresholds.
- 🔄 Real-time decision-making via infinite `while` loops in Bash.
- 📈 Live robot telemetry printing (position, orientation, IMU, velocity).
- 🛠 Simple and modular design using `robot_functions.bash` for parameter access.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- ROS 2 Humble (or compatible)
- A robot simulation or hardware exposing:
  - `/robot_interface` node with parameters like `cmd_vel_linear`, `scan_front_ray_range`, etc.
  - `ros2 param` CLI interface
- `bc` installed (for float comparison in Bash)
