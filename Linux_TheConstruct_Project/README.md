# Linux Turtle Bot Project

## A functional **obstacle avoider** written in Bash

This project involved implementing an obstacle avoidance program on the "TurtleBot3" robot. It collects information from scanners,  an IMU, and odometry to plot the best route based on the safest path. It uses Linux (.bash) and some _Python3_ and _Ros2_ functionality.

* I recommend you to visit my presentation of the project on *The Construct* [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/live/my1uggnVLkg?si=Qn4Eo9icft3ClaFf) channel to see how it works
