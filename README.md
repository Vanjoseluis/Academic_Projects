A curated collection of academic projects that I consider worth preserving in this little treasure chest called GitHub.

Welcome to my academic project repository. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Robotics Engineering at the University of Málaga (UMA). This repository contains a curated selection of academic projects developed during my training, focused on key areas such as robotics, automation, control systems, and embedded programming.

Each folder represents an independent project and includes a dedicated `README.md`, source code, and supporting materials where applicable. This repository serves as a structured index for easy navigation, review, and reference.

My main areas of interest include:

- 🤖 Mobile robotics  
- 🧠 Control systems  
- 🏭 Industrial automation  
- 🔌 Embedded systems  
- 📡 Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2)  
- 👁️ Perception and sensor integration

## 📁 Project Index

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| [Linux_TheConstruct_Project](Linux_TheConstruct_Project/) | Scripts developed during Linux training for robotics | Bash, Linux CLI |
| [Python_TurtleBot_Project](Python_TurtleBot_Project/) | Python scripts controlling a TurtleBot in simulation | Python, ROS2, Gazebo |


These academic projects laid the foundation for my current work in robotics software, including my recent contributions to the ROS 2 ecosystem and ros-controls.
