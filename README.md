# 🤖 Academic Projects – José Luis Pérez Martín

The Projects that I consider worth saving in this treasure chest called GitHub

#
Welcome to my academic project repository. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Robotics Engineering at the University of Málaga (UMA), class of 2022–2026. This repository contains a curated collection of projects developed throughout my academic training, focused on key areas such as robotics, automation, control systems, and embedded programming.

Each folder represents an independent project and includes a dedicated `README.md`, source code, and supporting materials where applicable. This repository serves as a structured index for easy navigation, review, and reference.

My main areas of interest include:

- 🤖 Mobile robotics  
- 🧠 Control systems  
- 🏭 Industrial automation  
- 🔌 Embedded systems  
- 📡 Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2)  
- 👁️ Perception and sensor integration  

- [Linux_TheConstruct_Project](Linux_TheConstruct_Project/)
- [Python_TurtleBot_Project](Python_TurtleBot_Project/)
