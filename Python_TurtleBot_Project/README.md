# Python Turtle Bot Project

## A functional **obstacle avoider** written in Python

This project involved implementing an obstacle avoidance program on the "TurtleBot3" robot. It collects information from scanners,  an IMU, and odometry to plot the best route based on the safest path. _Python3_ and some _Ros2_ functionality.

* Also my presentation of the project on *The Construct* [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/live/sTN2b3UEYlE?si=bRWYzU6NnODBstbc) channel to see how it works
